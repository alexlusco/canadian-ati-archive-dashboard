<h3>Accessing government information can be tricky. We want to make it
easier.</h3>
<p><font size="4"> Journalists, academics, lawyers, and members of the
public file tens of thousands of requests for information from the
Canadian Government every year. But previously filed Access to
Information (ATI) requests aren’t made public by default. Demand for
government information in Canada far exceeds what is accessible.</p>
<p>That’s why we built the Canadian ATI Archive. Civic technologists
have an important role to play in envisioning ways to improve how
governments engage with residents.</p>
<p>This dashboard allows you to easily search for previously completed
ATI requests from the Canadian Federal Government and locate documents
currently included in the Canadian ATI Archive. It was created by <a href="jamieduncan.me">Jamie Duncan</a> &amp; <a href="alexluscombe.ca">Alex Luscombe</a> using <a href="https://github.com/lchski/gc-ati-summaries-data">Lucas
Cherkewsky’s</a>) mirror of Federal ATI summaries. Files are stored on
the Internet Archive and can be explored using Google’s Pinpoint tool
for investigative journalists.</p>
